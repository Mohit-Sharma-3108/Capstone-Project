# Capstone-Project
Hotel booking cancellations prediction.

Hello!
In this project I have tried to make a model that predicts if a customer is going to honour their booking or not.

I have used feature engineering techniques and models like  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting.

**Difficulties faced** - Many categorical features had numerous subgroups which didnot much value to make prediction and increased the no of features after encoding to 900+ features

**Difficulties tackled** - Doing some form of feature engineering helped me decrease the no of features to 100+ features while retaining most of the information in those columns.(Psst! I didnot use PCA here)

**Outcome** -Predicted using Logistic Regression with accuracy 0.85 and f1‚Äê score 0.80 (performance metrics).

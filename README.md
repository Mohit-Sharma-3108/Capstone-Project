Hotel booking cancellations prediction.

Hello!
In this project I have tried to make a model that predicts if a customer is going to honour their booking or not.

I have used feature engineering techniques and models like  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and XGBoost.

Although XGBoost gave me the best accuracy/macro avg of F1-score , I decided to continue with Logistic Regression as it gave me meaningful interpretations which could lead to optimal actions. 

One such inference that I drew was that when a customer reserved room type G, the probability of the booking getting cancelled would increase, whereas the opposite would happen if the customer was assigned the room type G.
